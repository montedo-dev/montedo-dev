<p> Hi, I`m **Rafael Montedo**, self-styled as **montedo-dev.** </p>

<p> I work as a **Systems Analyst** and **Full Stack Developer** mainly using **PHP** and **ECMAScript.**</p>

<p>
My first contact with programming was writing **Perl** scripts for a bot in a MMORPG called Ragnarok Online, at that time I didn`t quite understand what programming was at that time and I was impressed with what a few words in a text editor could do.
</p>

<p>When I entered college I had contact with the C language and it was through it that I programmed my first algorithms and where I exercised my programming logic, at the end of the first semester I was already passionate about programming.
</p>

<p>
Over the months I started to specialize in** Web Based Systems** and got a job to be an **Full Stack Developer**  and in a short time I found myself acting as a **Systems Analyst **and becoming one a little later.
