<p> Hi, I`m <b>Rafael Montedo</b>, self-styled as <b>montedo-dev.</b> </p>

<p> I work as a <b>Systems Analyst</b> and <b>Full Stack Developer</b> mainly using <b>PHP</b> and <b>ECMAScript.</b></p>

<p>
My first contact with programming was writing <b>Perl</b> scripts for a bot in a MMORPG called Ragnarok Online, I didn`t quite understand what programming was at that time and I was impressed with what a few words in a text editor could do.
</p>

<p>When I entered college I had contact with the <b>C</b> language and it was through it that I programmed my first algorithms and where I exercised my programming logic, at the end of the first semester I was already passionate about programming.
</p>

<p>
Over the months I started to specialize in<b> Web Based Systems</b> and got a job to be an <b>Full Stack Developer</b>, in a short time I found myself acting as a <b>Systems Analyst </b>and becoming one a little later.
</p>

- Graduated in technology in Systems Analysis and Development.
- Currently attending a postgraduate course in Software Architecture.
